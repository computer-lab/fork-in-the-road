- For Experienced Developers: Many talented programmers develop substance abuse issues in
  the pressure-cooker environment of the tech industry.  Fork in the Road provides a place 
  for programmers to get professional help while getting back in touch with
  the work they love.
- For Novice Developers: Studies have shown that one of the major factors leading to substance 
  abuse relapses is an inability to find meaningful, well-compensated employment.  Fork in the Road
  runs a number of intensive programs that fully prepare students for a junior software developer role.
  Almost all of our students receive multiple job offers at the end of a six week program.
